  <h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Front-end developer, lately using Javascript and Actionscript at
	<a href="http://www.paperlesspost.com/">Paperless Post</a>.</p>
	<p>I'd rather not be limited by language and even domain labels, though. I've
	written everything from the most rough-and-ready PHP to the most abstract
	Java; and over my ten years in the business, I've seen the best and worst of
	both sides of the wire.</p>
