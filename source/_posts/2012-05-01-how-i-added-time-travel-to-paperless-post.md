We recently completed a major feature at Paperless Post:
[a full undo/redo system](http://dev.paperlesspost.com/blog/2012/05/01/how-we-added-time-travel-to-paperless-post/).
The post covers the Command pattern, and how easy it is to implement in both
JavaScript and ActionScript... and how hard it is to apply that implementation
to a large living application. I'll be posting some specific war stories in the
future, but for now, click through and enjoy.
