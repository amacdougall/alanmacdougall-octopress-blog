Abstract; conclusion that the book is necessary.

<!-- more -->

## Content

* 10x Myth
* Cost of Change Myth
* Cone of Uncertainty Myth
* Everything is a Myth
* How Myths Get Started

And in a larger sense...

* Progress from credulity to doubt to outrage
* On the writing of science
* Should we try to imitate science? Programming as sociology

Conclusion: book is necessary, but since it fails to confirm "founding myths" of
software development, it is doomed to be ignored.
