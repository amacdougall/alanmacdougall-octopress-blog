A series of posts on using functional programming concepts in everyday
ActionScript and JavaScript code. Uses
[underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) and
[underscore.as](https://github.com/amacdougall/underscore.as). This series is
very code-heavy, but covers a lot of very practical techniques you can use to
improve your code, from repetitive list filtering to high-level architecture.
